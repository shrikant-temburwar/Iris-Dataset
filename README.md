# Iris-Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization.

The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each, and then four numeric properties about those classes: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two.

I have performed various classification techniques to classify into three species using Dimensionality Reduction techniques such as PCA and LDA.
I also classified them by selecting two features to give better results.
